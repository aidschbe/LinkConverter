# LinkConverter

## Description
Simple file downloader made with WinForms, which converts all domains in given links into IPs before downloading.

This was to circumvent the overzealous domain blocking in our employee housing which wouldn't even let me access my personal cloud. 

## TODO:
- check if file before adding to download list
- prettify GUI (as much as possible with vanilla winforms)
- check for unhandled exceptions
- refactor for readability and maintainability
- properly name files
- add percent number to download status label
